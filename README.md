## Overview

### The challenge

This web app functions just like a regular calculator where a user can perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease.

### Links

- Live Site URL: [React Calculator](https://mehargiri.github.io/React-Calculator/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned about the react's state system especially the asynchronous nature of react's Hooks. I gained some experience with using useState and useReducer Hook for this project.

### Continued development

In future, I want to add additional functionalities such as exponentiation, square root, and the three trigonometric functions (cosine, sine, and tangent).
